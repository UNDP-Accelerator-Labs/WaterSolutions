Fresh water resources are getting exhausted at an exponential rate due to environmental changes, as well as the lack of sustainable planning. This project addresses three of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDGs); Clean Water and Sanitation (SDG 6), Affordable and Clean Energy (SDG 7), and Zero Hunger (SDG 2). People living in small towns or villages with no access to central services, will be the main beneficiaries of this project. The project is about developing a decentralized sewage unit for sewage purification for agricultural uses; the products are methane gas that serves as a source of energy, and agriculture fertilizers and water. The sewage bulk is filtered through a net, aerated, mixed with grinded moringa seed, and finally charcoal to remove color, taste, and odor. Moringa Oleifera (MO) is widely cultivated in Egypt; its seeds contain 35–40% oil, with potent antimicrobial activity as well as effective coagulant and heavy metal removal properties. The COD, BOD, TDS, and other bacterial count tests are carried out to ensure the suitability of the produced water for agriculture. Therefore, MO can be considered a natural and cheap alternative for chlorine and aluminum sulfate. Through this project, the sewage water treatment unit could be cost-effective and eco-friendly by sustaining the fresh drinking water and increasing the availability of agricultural water and natural safe fertilizers. This eventually leads to increasing crops production and supports the country’s economy.",https://acclabplatforms.blob.core.windows.net/solutions-mapping/uploads/sm/4a3b11cb-980f-46b2-9a28-f5fb4833806e/d114ff7850703bcf38148a411e58badc.png,31.1991806,29.8951716,,,,,,,Clean water and sanitation,Affordable and clean energy,Responsible consumption and production,,,,waste water management,waste to energy,,,,

6035,https://solutions.sdg-innovation-commons.org/en/edit/pad?id=6035,Mini grids for safe and affordable water supply to rural households,Bangladesh,"In Bangladesh, approximately 73 million individuals still lack access to safe water within their own homes. Merely 2% of rural households have the privilege of obtaining water through a piped water supply, meaning that an overwhelming 98% of rural households in Bangladesh are deprived of this convenience. The arduous task of collecting water falls on women and girls, who spend up to two hours each day engaged in this chore. Moreover, majority of households rely on potentially hazardous tube wells. Consequently, rural families, particularly children, face a heightened risk of diarrhoea, malnutrition, and stunted growth.

As a solution to this pressing issue, Max TapWater develops and operates mini grids for the provision of piped water supply, aiming to bring easy, safe, and affordable water to rural households in Bangladesh. By availing

this water supply services, households gain access to a continuous 24/7 water supply directly from their taps, with a minimum allocation of 80-100 litres per person per day across three water points within their homes (kitchen, toilet, and bathroom). Regular water quality testing is conducted to ensure the water's safety. The construction of these grids is not technically complex and relies on locally sourced materials. The innovation lies in the entrepreneurial model employed, which operates within small clusters of households and involves local entrepreneurs who can co-invest.

The project seeks alternatives and methods that take advantage of the Nejayote for the production of energy and agricultural products by identifying the needs of a community and connecting with ways in which it can mitigate the Nejayote contamination problem and also a way in which it can help millers to profit from the waste they produce.",https://acclabplatforms.blob.core.windows.net/solutions-mapping/uploads/sm/a1805503-b340-4e77-8c4a-49f4deed490f/07d999a18a9a3d2e5b349267edee0143.png,20.9670759,-89.6237402,,,,,,,Responsible consumption and production,Affordable and clean energy,"Industry, innovation and infrastructure",,,,industrial waste,circular economy,waste water management,,,

Desde niñas ayudaban a sus padres campesinos y fueron aprendiendo, de a poco, el trabajo agrícola en esos valles secos rodeados de montañas secas.
