Reduces the urban heat island effect: Traditional pavement surfaces absorb and retain heat, which contributes to the urban heat island effect - a phenomenon where cities are significantly warmer than their surrounding rural areas. Permeable paving surfaces reflect more sunlight and allow water to cool the surface, reducing the urban heat island effect.

However, water quality can vary considerably, and effective tools for real-time monitoring are crucial. In response to this need, an innovative system has been developed that uses sensor technology, WiFi connectivity and cloud services to assess and visualize water quality and provide timely alerts to users.

This is a program for a water quality detector using a home sensor.

Access to good quality, safe water is essential to the health and well-being of communities around the world. However, water quality can vary considerably, and effective tools for real-time monitoring are crucial. In response to this need, an innovative system has been developed that uses sensor technology, WiFi connectivity and cloud services to assess and visualize water quality and provide timely alerts to users.

This is a program for a water quality detector using a home sensor. The program measures water conductivity, calculates the TDS (Total Dissolved Solids) value, and sends the data to ThingSpeak for real-time viewing and monitoring. In addition, it uses the Twilio service to send text messages with the water quality classification according to the ranges established by the World Health Organization (WHO). It also includes functionality to sense water temperature using a DS18B20 sensor.

Problem: To obtain water, the villagers had to resort to the Naranjo River, 3 kilometers away; The time spent by women and children to carry water was four hours a day; For the washing of clothes, they had to move to the river and pay for transportation. Only two families in the village were supplied with water from artisanal wells. In addition to the weather, women put themselves at risk by leaving their homes too early to try to take advantage of the river's flow.

Solution: Formation of the COCODE as a tool to face the problem of water scarcity in the community and The community well is built, which has a system that supplies 465 jets for each house and 5 extra jets which are for communal use and are located in public areas.

Problem: Population growth, intensive agro-industrial use in the lower part of the basin and pressure on the forest in the upper part have generated a marked decrease in the flows of the Ixtacapa River. In addition to the above, the illegal extraction of wood and firewood, high levels of pollution, forest fires and overgrazing have had a negative impact on the recharge capacity and hydrological regulation of the area.

Solution: It began by consolidating the Association in a legal manner, establishing the statutes and developing a strategic plan for action and then identified the need to protect the upper part of the forest, so technical and economic support was provided to the communities of this region.

Description: This fog collection system was built as a prototype with the aim of testing the effectiveness of different fabrics for fog collection in rural areas of Colombia. The most positive result was obtained by the raschel mesh.

Interesting feature: Although the raschel mesh had a better ability to capture fog water, the other two fabrics can also be used if only these were available.

Description: Coconut fiber is a material that is extracted from coconuts, in order to reuse the organic matter that remains as waste when extracting the edible part of the coconut. It is very good for hydroponics as it retains moisture and is not compacted, which guarantees that there is oxygen, and that water circulates correctly throughout the crop.

Eventually it degrades and it is necessary to periodically change the substrate of hydroponic crops. One of the advantages of this product is that it can be obtained at a lower cost than other substrates, due to the fact of being extracted from a waste.

Once the water is stored, the beneficiary families can open a tap, which allows the passage of water through a filter that purifies the liquid, for later consumption.

Interesting features: It is a replicable method in different communities, since the organization has created a manual so that anyone can do it in their homes. In addition to capturing rainwater, it can filter it directly. The materials can be purchased at any hardware store and are relatively affordable.

En mayo de 2017, un grupo de organizaciones sociales impulsaron la primer ''Consulta Popular por el Derecho Humano al Agua'', esta se realizó en mayo de 2017, sin embargo, no se alcanzó la cantidad de votos necesario con el SÍ para que esta consulta fuera vinculante. Después, en 2019, con un movimiento social fortalecido e integrado por más organizaciones que estaban luchando por el Derecho Humano al Agua se prepararó la segunda ''Consulta Popular por el Derecho Humano al Agua''. Este nuevo proceso implicó una serie de acciones de información, sensibilización, organización, capacitación y comunicación para lograr un cambio social en el municipio.

Dos Consultas Populares por el Derecho Humano al Agua en Suchitoto marcaron una de las más importantes luchas que ha encabezado la sociedad civil organizada en el municipio. A casi dos años de la última Consulta Popular donde la ciudadanía dijo SÍ a declarar el agua como un derecho humano, el martes 21 de septiembre de 2021finalmente se pudo pasar de una declaratoria a una ordenanza que se encargará de regular actividades que pongan el riesgo el acceso al agua potable de calidad en Suchitoto.

Esta es una Solución Medioambiental de Base que ha sido identificada por el Laboratorio de Aceleración del Programa de las Naciones Unidas en El Salvador, con el apoyo de Plataforma Global, en el marco de la Gira de Mapeo de Soluciones Ambientales.

Tipo de solución

Ordenanza municipal.

Descripción

El proceso para que se firmara esta ordenanza municipal que sienta un precedente en Suchitoto para el acceso al vital líquido estuvo liderado por el Movimiento de Organizaciones Unidxs por el Agua en Suchitoto. Inicialmente debía ser la administración municipal la encargada de elaborar la Ordenanza pero frente a la falta interés del gobierno local por solventar la problemática, fue la Sociedad Civil la que decidió organizarse y ejercer su ciudadaní activa. Unidxs por el Agua asumió la creación de este documento que fue elaborado de manera participativa e integral, con insumos brindados por la población.

El 25 de mayo de 2021, la propuesta elaborada fue presentada ante el Concejo Municipal, obteniendo como resultado la creación de una comisión jurídica entre representantes de la Alcaldía Municipal de Suchitoto y Unidxs por el Agua. En un período de 90 días se encargarían de revisar, hacer sugerencias, modificaciones y subsanar vacíos que pudiera contener este instrumento. El proceso de revisión de los 31 artículos, que contenía en un principio la Ordenanza, tardó un poco más de los 90 días acordados. Según representantes de la municipalidad, la evaluación debía tardar lo necesario porque tenían que asegurarse que los artículos estuvieran basados en los marcos legales correspondientes.

Una vez revisados minuciosamente cada uno de los artículos, se presentó en el Concejo Municipal el ante proyecto de Ordenanza Municipal para la Protección y Conservación del Recurso Hídrico del Municipio de Suchitoto Departamento de Cuscatlán. Luego de la discusión interna del anteproyecto, la Alcaldía Municipal de conformidad al artículo 162 de la Ley de Procedimientos Administrativos, sometió a consulta pública de los habitantes del municipio el anteproyecto de Ordenanza, donde se esperaba que la ciudadanía dejara sugerencias u observaciones. Finalizado el tiempo estipulado no se registró ningún comentario, y esto dio a entender que la población estuvo de acuerdo con lo que la herramienta legal contenía.

El día jueves 16 de septiembre del mismo año se tenía prevista la aprobación de la Ordenanza para la Protección del Recurso Hídrico. En presencia de representantes de Unidxs por el Agua, Durán, ante el Concejo Municipal, se sometió a votación la aprobación del instrumento, el cual fue aprobado por unanimidad; sin embargo, el acto fue únicamente simbólico porque la herramienta no estaba impresa para que pudiera ser firmada por los Regidores Municipales. De esta manea, en una nueva sesión de Concejo realizada el martes 21 de septiembre se sometió nuevamente a votación la aprobación del instrumento, ya que se habían identificado errores de ortografía y de formas en el documento. En una discusión a puerta cerrada del Concejo Municipal se dio lectura a cada uno de los artículos que contiene la Ordenanza, 30 en total, coincidiendo cada uno de ellos con el acuerdo unánime de la municipalidad y el Movimiento UxA.

La aprobación de una ordenanza municipal para el tema del agua en Suchitoto es importante, pues significa un marco normativo que defiende no solamente los temas relacionados al agua, si no también las zonas de recarga, mantos acuíferos y los ecosistemas en general, que son necesarios para un equilibrio armónico con el medio ambiente y la vida.

Overall goal:  Enhance social stakeholders’ knowledge in southwestern Buenos Aires, Argentina, with respect to the risk of heavy rains, overflows, and floods, and encourage their participation in flood risk management processes. Specific goals:  Determine the population's perception and knowledge of flood and waterlogging hazards. Produce data and information and promote actions for flood risk management together with citizens and with the collaboration of different stakeholders. Raise flood hazard awareness by stressing the importance of knowledge and information regarding risks and their management.  Encourage debate and reflection based on the perceptions and experiences of local stakeholders on flooding events.  Add new features to InundApp which will enhance its use for flood risk management purposes.  Promote InundApp as a technological tool that integrates the culture of prevention in the population' s everyday life. Foster cooperation among participating organizations by defining coordination mechanisms in the event of actual or potential flooding events.

Collaborative project: Citizens participate in data collection and analysis

Objectives: 

• Raise awareness among young people and families on the health risks posed to their communities by dumping sites, rodents and parasites.

• Together with the education community, encourage the most vulnerable neighborhoods (due to this type of pollution) to trigger actions that will improve their quality of life.

Contributory project: It is designed by scientists, and citizens participate in data collection.

Overall goal: Continue the recent developments of the Working Group (WP) by improving the capture of flash flood videos and optimizing the performance of the software being developed by the WG for processing the flood images recorded by citizens. The discharges estimated on the basis of crowdsourced data will be reported to the authorities for flood hazard management. Specific goals:

• Give citizens the chance to share flood videos through a website to be later analyzed by the WG.

• Work on two new pillars for recording higher quality videos: 1) Selection of favorite sites for video recording identified by the WG together with the local Civil Defense personnel previously trained (by the WG) on video capture. A field survey is conducted in order to assess such topographic characteristics of the site as required for video processing. 2) Automation of video processing at fixed gauging stations using security cameras. These pillars require constant technological development at every stage of the process, namely: during video recording and processing, as well as during data transfer to authorities.

• Continue the development required by each stage so as to maximize systematization and minimize human intervention. The goal is to optimize the software developed by the WG using tailor-made hardware.

Description of citizen participation: Citizens, firefighters, civil defense staff, and law enforcement personnel record videos of flash floods in urban rivers and basins.
